# About Me!

## Interests and Hobbies!
  I enjoy rpg video games and hanging out with my girlfriend. Bears are my favorite animal by far and coding feels very nice to me. 

## Websites that I use often and recomend.
- [CodeCademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
  I use this whenever I want to learn a new subject as its fast and can filter by languages.
- [CarGurus](https://www.cargurus.com/)
  When I was finding my car, this was an invaluable to be able to search multiple dealerships at once.
